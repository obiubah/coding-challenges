### Build Your Own Memcached Server
This challenge is to build your own Memcached server. Memcached is a free, open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. It is intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by reducing database load.

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data retrieved from back end systems with higher latency. It is simple yet powerful.

Its simple design promotes quick deployment, ease of development, and solves many problems facing large data caches. Its relatively simple API is available for most popular languages.

Memcached was originally developed by Brad Fitzpatrick for LiveJournal in 2003. It was originally written in Perl and later ported to C.
